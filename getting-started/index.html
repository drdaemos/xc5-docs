#Choosing identifiers

Before you get started, you need to choose two identifiers:
- developer ID
- module ID

Your developer ID will tell other programmers that the module is written by you. For instance, all X-Cart modules have developer IDs CDev or XC. Module ID is basically the name of your module in the system, e.g. AustraliaPost or ProductFilter.
\
The identifiers must begin with an uppercase letter and may consist of a maximum of 64 alphanumeric characters.
