# Introduction

The video below demonstrates how to get a prolongation of access to X-Cart 5 updates after your period of free access to updates expires.

When you purchase a license for one of X-Cart 5 packages or modules, you get one year of free access to updates for that license.Â After one year, if you attempt to installan update for your store's core files or commercial modules, you will not be able to complete the task, as you will get one of the following messages in the Admin area of your store:

Expired license keys have been found that do not allow to proceed

Warning:X-Cart license key has been activated. However, this key is expired and does not allow getting upgrade packs from the Marketplace.  
See log file for details

Warning:The license key for the module "name" by "author" has been successfully verified and activated. However, this key is expired and does not allow getting module upgrade packs from the Marketplace.  
See log file for details

Error:Not all the upgrade packs have been downloaded. This may have been caused by one of the following:

*   slow Internet connection;

*   an internal problem on the Marketplace server;

*   a problem with your X-Cart license (expired license key, license key not matching the module license, etc.)

See log file for details

You can resolve the problem by following the instructions from the video below.
