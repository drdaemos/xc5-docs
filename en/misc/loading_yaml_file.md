## Introduction

{% note info  %}
We highly advise to use the {% link "X-Cart command line tool" ref_eg4htFFH %} to load YAML files. This guide is deprecated and considered uneffective.
{% endnote %}

This guide describes how developers can load updated YAML file of your module without running the command line tool.

Sometimes developers cannot use X-Cart CLI tool, because for some reason they cannot run console commands. They can still accomplish other tasks that are eased by macros except loading YAML file. This guide shows a way to load YAML file without having to uninstall/reinstall the module.

## Implementation

We need to create simple PHP script as follows:Â 

```php
<?php

require_once 'top.inc.php';

$path = 'path/to/your/yaml/file.yaml';

\XLite\Core\Database::getInstance()->loadFixturesFromYaml($path);
```

and run it through the browser. Of course `$path` variable must contain an actual path to your YAML file.
