## Introduction

This article describes the structure of X-Cart classes. Also, it describes how to generate namespaces correctly.

## X-Cart classes

All X-Cart classes are located in the `<X-Cart>/classes/` directory. Let us walk through each type of X-Cart classes:

*   `<X-Cart>/classes/XLite.php` is the class of the whole application; you will never use it in new modules;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Base/` directory contains definitions of basic X-Cart interfaces including **Decorator** interface that allows {% link "applying changes to every part of X-Cart store" ref_AF6bmvL6 %} without modifying core classes;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Controller/` directory contains definitions of classes that **handle requests** to X-Cart (controllers). Check {% link "general X-Cart workflow" ref_AF6bmvL6#general-x-cart-workflow %} article in order to learn more about controller classes;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Core/` directory contains definitions of core X-Cart entities, such as database, HTTP request, Mailer etc;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/DataSet/` directory includes the classes that defines different data structures; they are seldom used in the modules;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Logic/` folder contains the classes that describe the business logic of complex routines: order calculation, import/export, etc;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Model/` directory includes the classes that describe different X-Cart entities, such as products, orders, users, shipping and payment methods, menus etc;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Module/` folder contains files added by modules (default and 3rd party ones); if you {% link "write the module" ref_G2mlgckf %}, you will put your files into this folder only; all module files (except templates) are stored in the `<X-Cart>/classes/Module/<developer-ID>/<module-ID>` directories;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/Upgrade/` directory contains classes that are used during upgrade procedure;
*   `<X-Cart>/classes/View/` folder contains classes that manage X-Cart's output.

## Generating namespaces

[Namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) are widely used constructions in OOP languages (PHP in particular). They allow to save time and not mix up different classes with the same name.

Namespace notation in X-Cart is straight-forward: it repeats the class' sub-path of the .php file in the `<X-Cart>/classes/` directory.

*   PHP class defined in the `<X-Cart>/classes/XLite/Controller/Customer/Product.php` file will have namespace`Â XLite\Controller\Customer`; i.e. namespace includes all names of folders after `<X-Cart>/classes/` separated by backslash (**\**)
*   The same way, PHP class defined in the `<X-Cart>/classes/XLite/View/Header.php` file will have namespace `XLite\View`;
*   Namespace can be quite long, e.g. if the class is located in the `<X-Cart>/classes/XLite/Module/CDev/AustraliaPost/Model/Shipping/Processor/AustraliaPost.php` file, then its namespace will be `XLite\Module\CDev\AustraliaPost\Model\Shipping\Processor`;
*   PHP class defined in the `<X-Cart>/classes/XLite.php` file will have no namespace.

_Important note: if you have PHP class **MyClass**, it must be placed into the **MyClass.php** file. Name of the class must be the same as the name of the .php file it contains._
