This guide explains the main steps to set up an X-Cart store. Please refer to it to make sure you don't forget any key tasks before the store launch. [Contact X-Cart professionals](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html) if you need assistance at any step: we’re just one call or email away ;)

## Step 1: Obtaining an X-Cart license and installing software

1.  Follow the link below to compare X-Cart packages and choose the most suitable one: [http://www.x-cart.com/software_pricing.html](http://www.x-cart.com/software_pricing.html). Download the software. If you select a commercial package, purchase a license to get a license key. 

2.   If you have a web server, check if it meets [X-Cart system requirements](http://kb.x-cart.com/display/XDD/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-Serverrequirements) and make the necessary adjustments. If you have no web server, or it doesn’t qualify, consider [X-Cart Hosting], which is fine-tuned for optimal X-Cart performance, or select one of our trusted partners.


Once the hosting is ready, proceed to X-Cart installation. See a detailed Installation guide here.
