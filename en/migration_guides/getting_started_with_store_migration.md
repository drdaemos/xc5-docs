This guide explains the main steps to set up an X-Cart store. Please refer to it to make sure you don't forget any key tasks before the store launch. [Contact X-Cart professionals](https://www.x-cart.com/contact-us.html) if you need assistance at any step: we’re just one call or email away ;)

## Step 1: Obtaining an X-Cart license and installing software

1.  Follow the link below to compare X-Cart packages and choose the most suitable one: [http://www.x-cart.com/software_pricing.html](http://www.x-cart.com/software_pricing.html). [Download](https://www.x-cart.com/download.html) the software. If you select a commercial package, purchase a license to get a license key. 

2.  If you have a web server, check if it meets [X-Cart system requirements](http://kb.x-cart.com/display/XDD/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-Serverrequirements) and make the necessary adjustments. If you have no web server, or it doesn’t qualify, consider [X-Cart Hosting](http://www.x-cart.com/hosting.html), which is fine-tuned for optimal X-Cart performance, or select one of our [trusted partners](http://partners.x-cart.com/hosting-companies).

3.   Once the hosting is ready, proceed to X-Cart installation. See a detailed Installation guide [here](http://kb.x-cart.com/display/XDD/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-Installationprocess).

4.   Once your X-Cart is installed, you will see a pop-up window suggesting that you register your free license ([see how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEncqXpJ8qc)) or activate a paid edition license (see [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmedPCQ91yA)). Follow the procedure in accordance with the X-Cart package chosen.

## Step 2: Data migration with a store-migration app

The easiest way to migrate store data is to use the service provided by X-Cart partners Cart2Cart. They guarantee the finest quality of data transfer to your new X-Cart store. With a number of ready-made migration modules that we provide, this task should be easy.

1.   Open X-Cart admin back-end –> Modules –> View more addons in Marketplace and search by the search term "migrate". 

2.   Find the module showing the name of your current shopping cart platform. Presently, we support migration from Magento, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, Shopify, OsCommerce, BigCommerce, Interspire, ZenCart and [more](http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons?price=All&price=All&keys=Migrate&sort_by=created&sort_by=created&sort_order=DESC&sort_order=DESC), see the entire list in the Marketplace via the X-Cart admin area. 

3.   Install the module and register a Cart2Cart account, or sign in if you already have one.

4.   Enter the FTP credentials of your current store to upload the Connection Bridge.

5.   Let Cart2Cart upload the Connecting Bridge to your X-Cart automatically.

6.   After being redirected to the Cart2Cart website, choose the entities you’re willing to move to X-Cart.

7.   Finish a free Demo and launch the Full Migration.

## Step 3: Check and organize your products after the migration

If you have added products to X-Cart via a migration app, it is important to verify the products afterwards.

1.   {% link "Check the product details" ref_fhzzxDTy %}, which includes product descriptions, images, variants and meta descriptions - depending on your previous software.

2.   {% link "Configure the taxes" ref_kJmd7K27 %} you require for your products or automate tax calculation via [Avatax Sales Tax calculation service](http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons/avatax-sales-tax-automation.html) by Avalara.

3.   Make sure the products are arranged in categories correctly and are easy to find (Admin back-end –> Catalog –> Categories).

4.   {% link "Add Featured products" ref_4iFdpTdv %} on the home page and/or category pages.

5.   If your products have options and variants, use the {% link "product classes and attributes feature" ref_T90ZcEpP %} to set them up. You may need them if your products have such parameters as color, size, material, country of origin, ISBN, technical specifications, etc.

6.   Optimize the store catalog pages for SEO: define meta elements of your product and category pages - such as the page title, meta description and meta keywords; set up seo-friendly URLs.
