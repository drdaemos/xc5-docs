Hooray, an article about X-Cart decorator system has been published at the major developer portal [Sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/achieving-modular-architecture-with-forwarding-decorators/ "Article about Forwarding Decorators featured at Sitepoint.com")! This article explains our concept for approaching modularity in the app - wrapping classes in other classes and recompiling everything; we recommend any X-Cart developer to read it.

Also, we are working on the second part of this article, explaining internals of the decorator compiler. Stay tuned!
