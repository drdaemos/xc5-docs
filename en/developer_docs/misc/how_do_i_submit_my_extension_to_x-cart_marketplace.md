1.  Send us message at [alliance@x-cart.com](mailto:alliance@x-cart.com) and we will create you a partner account
2.  Write the module and make sure that it is done according to our standards
3.  Upload your module to the marketplace and we will review it
4.  Create your module's page in our marketplace at [http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons](http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons)

This article will explain each step, so you will be confident about what is going to happen.

# Get partner account

First of all, if you decide to write extensions for X-Cart 5 (theme or module), you need to obtain developer NFR license. For that, please send us a message at [alliance@x-cart.com](mailto:alliance@x-cart.com) with the following information:

1.  What module you are going to write
2.  Your company name

3.  Your web-site address

4.  Email for your partner account

5.  Developer ID you prefer ([learn more about developer ID](http://kb.x-cart.com/display/XDD/How+to+create+a+module#Howtocreateamodule-Choosingidentifiers))

Once you send us this info, we will create you a partner account and you will be able to log into it at [http://my.x-cart.com/](http://my.x-cart.com/) 

There you will be able to find a key for your development purposes.

# Write module

Next step is to write the module you want. We have several simple requirements to your module's code:

1.  PHP code must comply to [PSR2 standard]({{ baseurl_lang }}/developer_docs/misc/testing_module_for_code_style.html)
2.  PHP code must not use any encryption
3.  Your module must not compromise store's owner and must not contain malicious code. If we find an attempt to use malicious code in your module, you will not be allowed to post modules to the marketplace ever since and your existing modules will be removed from it as well.
4.  The initial version of your module must be 0, i.e. 5.0.0, 5.1.0, etc depending on what version of X-Cart you module is going to be compatible with.

Beside that, we ask to create a demo of your module on any external web-site, so we could see your module in action.

# Upload module to marketplace

In order to upload your module to the marketplace, please go to your partner account in [http://my.x-cart.com/](http://my.x-cart.com/) and then go to the **Modules** section. There, you will be able to upload module for review using the **Add new module **button as shown on snapshot below.

Once we receive a module, we will review it during a week (usually faster). The main purpose of module review is to check that its code comply to our standards (**Write module** section above). We are not testing the functionality of your module and we do not aim to find bugs in it. This is developer's responsibility, although we will not hide any found bugs from you.

If we find that something must be corrected, you will receive a list of required changes by email.

# Publish module page on our web-site

Once the module is accepted, it will be available to all X-Cart merchants via built-in marketplace. Besides that we want to create a dedicated page for your module that will contain detailed description, snapshots etc on our web-site: [http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons](http://www.x-cart.com/extensions/addons)

In order to publish such page, please write us a message [alliance@x-cart.com](mailto:alliance@x-cart.com) and our marketing manager will discuss this matter with you. Usually, we initiate such process ourselves right after the module is accepted.
