The Design guidelines provides a relatively high-level introduction and view of the X-Cart  product.

The X-Cart  platform and components are explained from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), extension developers, system admins, installers, and integrators.

More detailed information about building online stores, using the X-Cart  APIs, installing, configuring, and extending the platform is included in other books in the X-Cart  library.
